# Pitch for Build Club Hackathon 2024: AI for a Better World

---

## Introduction

Every day in Australia, 8.6 lives are lost to suicide. This tragic statistic reflects not just a national crisis but a profound human suffering that permeates families, communities, and the entire social fabric. Our mission is to leverage AI to address this critical issue head-on. Our app **Here-to-Help.ai** aims to revolutionise the support systems for those in crisis, specifically targeting the emotional and psychological toll on crisis support workers who are often the last line of defense against suicide.

## Problem Statement

Suicide is the leading cause of death for Australians aged 15 to 44. Vulnerable populations such as men, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, rural communities, and the LGBTIQ+ community face disproportionately higher risks. Crisis support workers at organisations like Lifeline are essential, yet the emotional stress and cognitive load they bear are immense. Lifeline receives a call every 28 seconds, translating to over a million desperate calls for help annually. The support workers’ ability to provide meaningful, empathetic assistance can be compromised by the sheer volume and intensity of these interactions.

## Our Solution

To address this, we present our AI-powered app, specifically designed to **augment** the capabilities of crisis support workers. Our app seamlessly integrates advanced AI technologies to enhance real-time communication and support, ultimately aiming to save lives and improve mental health outcomes. Here’s how it works:

1. **Real-time Transcription and Analysis:**
   - Our app transcribes conversations in real-time, allowing crisis workers to focus entirely on the caller without the distraction of note-taking. This real-time transcription is immediately available for review, providing instant context and clarity.

2. **Contextual Suggestions and Insights:**
   - Utilising a powerful speech-to-text LLM, our app analyses the ongoing conversation and offers real-time suggestions, reminders, and action plans tailored to the caller’s specific needs. This dynamic support ensures that critical cues are not missed and that the crisis worker can respond with the most appropriate and effective interventions.

3. **Emotional and Cognitive Support for Workers:**
   - By reducing the cognitive load on crisis workers, our app helps mitigate the emotional toll they experience. It provides them with a safety net of insights and suggestions, allowing them to perform their role with greater confidence and less stress.

## Technical Implementation

Our app is built to ensure robust performance and scalability:

- **Next.js** for a seamless and responsive user interface.
- **TypeScript** for reliable and maintainable code.
- **Tailwind CSS** for a modern and adaptive design.
- **Groq** for efficient data querying and processing.
- **Relevance.ai** for advanced speech-to-text capabilities and real-time transcription accuracy.

## Utility and Impact

The utility of our app lies in its ability to provide immediate, actionable insights and support, significantly enhancing the capacity of crisis support workers to manage high-stakes conversations. By offering real-time transcription and context-aware suggestions, our app ensures that no critical detail is overlooked, and every call is handled with the utmost care and professionalism. This not only improves the effectiveness of crisis interventions but also contributes to the mental well-being of the support workers themselves.

---

## Conclusion

Our app embodies the theme of "AI for a better world" by addressing one of the most pressing public health challenges: suicide prevention. By empowering crisis support workers with AI-driven tools, we enhance their ability to provide compassionate, effective support to those in desperate need.
